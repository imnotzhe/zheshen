            <h2> What is space?</h2>
            <p class="lead">Space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely low pressure. In space, sound doesn't carry because there aren't molecules close enough together to transmit sound between them. 
            Not quite empty, bits of gas, dust, and other matter float around "emptier" areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can host planets, stars and galaxies.

               <p class="lead" >Mercury is a heavy, silvery-white metal that is liquid at room temperature. Compared with other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.</p>
              
               <h2>Venus</h2>
               <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5blH6h36pmAZ-0gC0kmIaA0CsvYAe_8XklA&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400">
               <p class="lead">Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it's perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.</p>
    
              <h2>Earth</h2>
              <img src="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/03/06/bluemarble3k-smaller-nasa_custom-644f0b7082d6d0f6814a9e82908569c07ea55ccb-s1100-c50.jpg" alt="The earth" width="400" height="400">
              <p class="lead">
                Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.</p>
        
             <h2>mars</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQt8CX2Rh3NpRjuxUzXnkvUMFHyrK_9VZFaYw&usqp=CAU" width="700" height="400">
             <p class="lead">Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.></p>
            
             <h2>jupiter</h2>
             <img src="https://t1.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcRS5G-fpV8aDvEWIAPzCqEL1jEWMJl5d2YxkLcVUhNlbFJSasq1s4dNjaJpj4Tgldcl" width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead">Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system.</p>
            
             <h2>Saturn</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRPcmdXU4ymUbbHNBd_rL6WBMdOzC0eVRxm_A&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead ">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.</p>
            
             <h2>Uranus</h2>
             <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Uranus.jpg/360px-Uranus.jpg" width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead">Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).</p>
            
             <h2>Neptune</h2>
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTYuy4z52MoYrz3kPNcIlDhWS1ZH8HDMu1fag&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400"></a>
             
             <p class="lead">Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus.</p>
            
             <h2>Now i wanna start on something that is intresting, the type of galaxies in our universe.</h2>
            
             <h2>Spiral galaxies</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTiFoZgbHzPsohwrSWZzk3CZVzZDnJGs6Gthg&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead">A spiral galaxy typically has a rotating disc with spiral 'arms' that curve out from a dense central region. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. </p>
            
             <h2>Barred spiral galaxies</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS7nIBhU5XNpwtsXiD-iYoO13hOB0bgjcjKlQ&usqp=CAU"width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead">Barred spirals differ from normal spiral galaxies in that the arms of the galaxy do not lead all the way into the centre, but are connected to the two ends of a straight bar of stars which contains the nucleus at its centre. Approximately two-thirds of all spiral galaxies are thought to be barred spiral galaxies.</p>
            
             <h2>elliptical galaxy</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQG_vTPDFLi-YOWvHT8e6WXOmu5hkeOUMAEkA&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead">Elliptical galaxies have shapes that range from completely round to oval. They are less common than spiral galaxies. Unlike spirals, elliptical galaxies usually contain little gas and dust and show very little organization or structure.</p>
            
             <h2>Irregular galaxies</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQDsH5_BqENlQ7fbakUxoFDURZaWrHIQLplKg&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead">Irregular galaxies have no particular shape. They are among the smallest galaxies and are full of gas and dust. Having a lot of gas and dust means that these galaxies have a lot of star formation going on within them. This can make them very bright.</p>
             
            
             <h1>Now i am gonna introduce to all of u, the most mysterious thing in the universe ----- The black hole.</h1>
            
             <h1>Types of black holes</h1>
            
             <h2>Stellar mass black holes</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTeKiVQtsSF6qHkUyeTFmBGDG-gXl4aF0AOsg&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead">Stellar-mass black holes are born when extremely massive stars collapse and typically weigh between five and 10 times the mass of the Sun. </p>
            
             <h2>supermassive black holes</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTiFoZgbHzPsohwrSWZzk3CZVzZDnJGs6Gthg&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400">
             
             <p class="lead">On the other end of the size spectrum are the giants known as "supermassive" black holes, which are millions, if not billions, of times as massive as the Sun. Astronomers believe that supermassive black holes lie at the center of virtually all large galaxies, even our own Milky Way. </p>
             
             <h2>intermediate x`black holes</h2>
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJe7w4wH6k87iWwByYjbcOrXPhLEYxx6b6NQ&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="400">
             <p class="lead">Intermediate-mass black holes are thought to form when multiple stellar-mass black holes undergo a series of mergers with one another. These mergers frequently happen in crowded areas of galaxies. Merging stellar-mass black holes spend a very long time in the early stages of their mating dance. </p>
